- **Alexa Integration**: Controls the pump through voice commands via Alexa.
- **Blynk App**: Provides real-time monitoring and manual pump control.

## Components
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Breadboard
- Jump wires
- Soil moisture sensor
- Water pump
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor

## Setup
